| Project Description |
| :---- |
| Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Make sure to include the following: Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project. Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem. This section should have 2 paragraphs. |
|  Our team is building a software an employer uses during hiring to automatically scan through resumes (job applications) and look for key items based on their job listing/requirements. Problem: Employers often receive an overwhelming number of job applications, making it time-consuming to manually review each resume for key qualifications, leading to inefficiencies and potential oversights in the hiring process. Solution: By automatically scanning resumes for key qualifications based on job requirements, this software streamlines the hiring process by reducing manual workload, minimizing oversights, and ensuring that only the most relevant candidates are considered.  |

| Value |
| :---- |
| Please describe in more detail why your project is valuable. Answer the following questions: What are the benefits to getting this right? What are the risks if you don't get it right? What are the risks that will make executing this project difficult? This section should have 3 paragraphs. |
|  Getting this right improves hiring efficiency, ensures better candidate matching, reduces bias, and saves time and resources for the employer. If we don’t get it right, poorly matched candidates may be overlooked or wrongly prioritized, leading to bad hires, increased turnover, and wasted time and resources. Challenges to executing this project include accurately parsing diverse resume formats, handling variations in terminology, minimizing bias in keyword matching, and ensuring compliance with hiring regulations.  |

| Deliverables |
| :---- |
| Please describe in detail what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished. This section should have 3 paragraphs. |
|  The final deliverable for this project will be a fully functional, web-based applicant tracking system (ATS), built in Python, designed to streamline and improve the hiring process for companies. The core functionality will include: User-Friendly Web Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface for recruiters to manage job postings, review candidate resumes, and track applicant's progress. Resume Parsing and Job Description Extraction: A resume parsing feature that extracts and highlights key information like name, contact information, work experience, skills, and education, from the uploaded resumes, based on the job description provided by the recruiter. Resume Ranking: A system to rank and filter resumes based on criteria from the job description provided by the recruiter, such as education, work experience, and skills. Structured Data Storage: A database(e.g., MYSQL or SQLite) will store job descriptions, resumes, and user information in a simple structured format for easy retrieval and analysis (Stretch goal) Job Postings: Recruiters can create and edit job postings through the platform, while candidates submit resumes through a dedicated portal. The application will be developed using Python web frameworks like Django or Flask, which means scalability, simple access for future maintenance, and great user experience. At a minimum, the software will deliver the following core features: Resume upload and parsing  basic candidate filtering and ranking based on the job description simple user-friendly web interface for applicant progress and reviewing candidates resumes Stretch Goals: To further better our product, these additional features could be added as time permits: Applicant Self-Assessment Tool: a feature allowing candidates to upload their resumes and receive a score based on a specific job description. This would help applicants optimize their resumes for future job applications by making sure they are ATS compatible. Analytics Dashboard for recruiters: A Simple-to-read but data-rich dashboard providing recruiters with key metrics and insights such as: Number of applicants  Average candidate score skill trends among applicants These stretch goals are here to provide additional value to both recruiters and candidates, making the ATS not only a hiring tool but also a candidate self-improvement site.  |
